This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

Ultramodern skyscrapers rising against an azure sky forms the gleaming skyline of this cosmopolitan city. As night cloaks Dubai, the city comes alive with twinkling lights adorning these tall superstructures. A drive along Downtown Dubai at night leaves you mesmerized by a fantasy land of lights and colours that surrounds you. Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, will leave you open-mouthed in wonder. Fall under the spell of the largest dancing fountain in the world, the Dubai Fountain. Swim with the sharks in the gigantic aquarium at Dubai Mall and lose yourself to a world of make-believe at Mall of the Emirates. A curious blend of traditions and modernization can be seen in every corner of Dubai. A perfect example of this is Al Fahidi Fort, the oldest building in Dubai which is surrounded by a fast-paced metropolis. The sprawling Miracle Garden and Dubai Creek Park is a testament to the determination of the people of Dubai, to beat the odds and grow vibrant blooms smack in the middle of the desert."

"about": "Thekkady is a small area within the Idukki district of Kerala and is known for the multiple places of tourist interest within the region. Periyar National Park and Periyar Tiger Reserve are one of the major tourist attractions in Thekkady. With a total area of over 770 square km, of which around 360 square kilometers are evergreen forest, Periyar National Park provides a lot of opportunities for exploration, nature rambling, and wildlife viewing. Some of the species that inhabit the area are elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur or Indian bison, langurs, and macaques. Apart from the reserve, there are other attractions close by such as the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple, the Cardamom Hills, Chellar Kovil waterfalls and many others. Thekkady is close to the Western Ghats, and thus there are many picturesque areas around it which can be visited directly for basking in the beauty of the hills. It also provides great opportunities for treks and hikes through its many misty hills. The Periyar river flows through the park, and the Mullaperiyar Dam creates a reservoir on one end of it. This area, thus also provides excellent panoramic views of the river as well as of the tank."

"overview":"From pristine beaches to famed wildlife reserves, Kerala offers its travellers an experience that will completely rejuvenate their mind, body and soul. While Munnar offers abundant scenic beauty, spice plantations in Thekkady lend a heady aroma of different spices. With palm-fringed backwaters and houseboat cruise, Alleppey never fails to delight anyone. All in all, Kerala marks a perfect place to relax and de-stress amidst tranquil environs.",
"about": "Thekkady is a small area within the Idukki district of Kerala and is known for the multiple places of tourist interest within the region. Periyar National Park and Periyar Tiger Reserve are one of the major tourist attractions in Thekkady. With a total area of over 770 square km, of which around 360 square kilometers are evergreen forest, Periyar National Park provides a lot of opportunities for exploration, nature rambling, and wildlife viewing. Some of the species that inhabit the area are elephants, sambar, tigers, gaur or Indian bison, langurs, and macaques. Apart from the reserve, there are other attractions close by such as the Mangala Devi Kannagi Temple, the Cardamom Hills, Chellar Kovil waterfalls and many others. Thekkady is close to the Western Ghats, and thus there are many picturesque areas around it which can be visited directly for basking in the beauty of the hills. It also provides great opportunities for treks and hikes through its many misty hills. The Periyar river flows through the park, and the Mullaperiyar Dam creates a reservoir on one end of it. This area, thus also provides excellent panoramic views of the river as well as of the tank."
